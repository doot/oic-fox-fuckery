# OicFoxFuckery

This is a very basic application that provides an API to annotate a given OIC
beer league hockey calendar with any overlapping shows at the nearby Fox Theater.
You can subscribe to this calendar so that you can automatically learn if a show
at the Fox is going to fuck you over.

This is a super basic app just to learn a bit of rust, I do not know what I am doing.
